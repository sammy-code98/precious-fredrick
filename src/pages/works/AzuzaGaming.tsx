                            One of the greatest challenges I faced while working on Asuza was designing a platform
                            that was seamless and intuitive for both gamers and tournament organizers to use.
                            Despite the innovative nature of Asuza, it was important to ensure that the design was both visually appealing and aligned with the brand's core values of community,
                            friendship, and healthy competition.

                            As a designer, my primary objectives for the Asuza platform were to create a unique
                            and user-friendly experience for finding tournaments and connecting with favorite gaming communities.
                            My goal was to drive user acquisition and position Asuza as a leader in the African esports management market. Through careful planning and attention to detail,
                            I worked to achieve these objectives and enhance the overall value of the platform for all users

                                The design process for Asuza began with the creation of a mood board to establish the desired brand identity and user experience. I developed two themes for the site - one with a neon tech aesthetic and the other with an African community focus. After presenting these options to the Asuza team and receiving feedback, we ultimately decided that the neon tech theme best reflected the community we were building.
                                This decision was made through careful consideration and collaboration with the team.

                                    The logo for Asuza was designed by our in-house graphics designer,
                                    and I was responsible for developing the logo's use cases within the app. Through careful planning and attention to detail,
                                    I worked to ensure that the logo was integrated seamlessly and effectively into the overall design of the platform.

                                    Through a thorough brainstorming process and competitive analysis, I was able to generate design solutions for Asuza that incorporated feedback from the team. These solutions included the implementation of a campaign feature, a blog and news tab, and other features that helped to enhance the user experience and set Asuza apart in
                                    the market. My goal was to create a platform that was intuitive, engaging, and effective for all users.

                                Gamification of the Asuza platform was a key strategy for increasing user engagement. This was achieved through the implementation of features that made it easy for regular users to host tournaments and promote them within and outside of the platform. Additionally, we introduced a reward system to increase user curiosity and drive participation. These efforts helped to make Asuza a more dynamic and engaging experience for all users.
